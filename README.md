Biodiversity Dashboard

As part of this project, I utilized a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and the D3 library to develop a dashboard that features interactive charts for exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the various types of microbes that are found in human navels.

Interactive Drop-Down Menu

I developed an interactive drop-down menu that displays the identification numbers for each of the study's participants. Selecting a new ID from the menu updates the charts on the dashboard to display the corresponding data for the selected individual.

Dynamic Demographic Information

The dashboard also displays demographic information for each of the participants in the study. This information is dynamically updated based on the selected individual from the drop-down menu.

Horizontal Bar Chart

To provide a more detailed view of the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for each individual, I created a horizontal bar chart. This chart is updated based on the selected individual in the drop-down menu. The chart can be used to view the relative abundance of the top 10 OTUs for each participant.

Bubble Chart

Additionally, I created a bubble chart to display each sample for the selected individual. The chart showcases the relative abundance of each OTU in the selected individual's sample.

The data used in this project was collected by the Public Science Lab, Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University. The dataset can be accessed and viewed here.
